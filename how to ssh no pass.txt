Generate SSH Key Pair:

If you donâ€™t already have an SSH key pair, generate one:

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"

Follow the prompts to save the key (default location is ~/.ssh/id_rsa) and optionally set a passphrase.

Copy Public Key to Remote Server:

ssh-copy-id user@remote-server

This command will prompt for your remote user password and copy your public key to the remote server.

Verify Passwordless SSH:

Test the SSH connection to ensure it no longer requires a password:

ssh user@remote-server

If successful, your script can now connect to the remote server without requiring a password.
